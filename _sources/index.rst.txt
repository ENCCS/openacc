Who is the course for?
----------------------

This training is for students, researchers, engineers and programmers
who would like to quickly get started with GPU programming using
OpenACC.  Some previous experience with C/C++ or Fortran
is required, and the lesson furthermore assumes that participants have
some familiarity with the following topics:

- Logging in to supercomputers and using a bash terminal
- Compiling C/C++ or Fortran codes using compilers and makefiles
  

About the course
----------------

This lesson is an introduction to GPU programming using the
directive-based OpenACC paradigm. The course consists of lectures, type-along and hands-on
exercises. Topics covered include the architecture of the GPU
accelerators, basic usage of OpenACC, and how to control data
movement between CPUs and GPUs. Basic optimization of the code will
also be covered. 

After the course the participants should have the basic skills needed
for utilising OpenACC with new or existing programs.

The participants are assumed to have knowledge of Fortran and/or C
programming languages. Since participants will be using HPC clusters
to run the examples, fluent operation in a Linux/Unix environment is
assumed.
