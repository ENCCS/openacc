What is OpenACC ?
-----------------

-  OpenACC defines a set of compiler directives that allow code regions
   to be offloaded from a host CPU to be computed on a GPU

   -  High level GPU programming
   -  Large similarity to OpenMP directives

-  Support for both C/C++ and Fortran bindings
-  Extensive guides, tutorials, code samples and documentation on the OpenACC standard
   can be found at `www.openacc.org <http://www.openacc.org>`_.

OpenACC vs. CUDA or HIP
-----------------------

-  Why OpenACC and not `CUDA <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA>`_ / `HIP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPUOpen#AMD_Boltzmann_Initiative>`_?

   -  Easier to work with
   -  Porting of existing software requires less work
   -  Same code can be compiled to CPU and GPU versions easily

-  Why CUDA/HIP and not OpenACC?

   -  Get access to all features of the GPU hardware
   -  More optimization possibilities

How to port code to GPU with OpenACC?
-------------------------------------

- Compilers that support OpenACC usually require an option that enables the feature

   -  PGI (now NVIDIA HPC SDK): ``-acc``
   -  Cray: ``-hacc``
   -  GNU (partial support): ``-fopenacc``

   - Without these options a regular CPU version is compiled!

- OpenACC data model

   -  host manages memory of the device
   -  host copies data to/from the device

- OpenACC execution model

   -  Host-directed execution with an attached accelerator
   -  Part of the program is usually executed by the host
   -  Computationally intensive parts are *offloaded* to the accelerator
      that executes *parallel regions*

+---------+-----------------+--------------+----------------+------------------+

-  OpenACC uses compiler directives for defining compute regions (and
   data transfers) that are to be performed on a GPU
-  Important constructs

   -  ``parallel``, ``kernels``, ``data``, ``loop``, ``update``,
      ``host_data``, ``wait``

-  Often used clauses

   -  ``if (condition)``, ``async(handle)``

OpenACC data model
------------------
-  Define a region with data declared in the device memory

   -  C/C++: ``#pragma acc data [clauses]`` 
   -  Fortran: ``!$acc data [clauses]``
   -  clauses can be ``copy``, ``copyin``, ``copyout``, and ``present``

   - ``copy(var-list)`` **on entry:** if data is present on the device on entry, behave as   with the *present* clause, otherwise allocate memory on the device  and copy data from the host to the device.  **on exit:** copy data from the device to the host and deallocate memory on the device if it was allocated on entry

   - ``copyin(var-list)`` **on entry:** same as *copy* on entry, **on exit:** deallocate memory on the device if it was allocated on entry

   -  ``copyout(var-list)`` **on entry:** if data is present on the device on entry, behave as with the *present* clause, otherwise allocate memory on the device **on exit:** same as *copy* on exit

   -  ``present(var-list)``  **on entry/exit:** assume that memory is allocated and that data is present on the device

   - ``create(var-list)``  **on entry:** allocate memory on the device, unless it was already present,  **on exit:** deallocate memory on the device if it was allocated on entry

   - ``reduction(operator:var-list)`` the operator can be ``+,-,*,max,min``, Performs reduction on the (scalar) variables in list

-  Data transfers take place

   -  from the **host** to the **device** upon entry to the region
   -  from the **device** to the **host** upon exit from the region

-  Functionality defined by *data clauses*
-  *Data clauses* can also be used in ``kernels`` and ``parallel``
   constructs

Data specification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Data clauses specify functionality for different variables
-  Overlapping data specifications are not allowed
-  For array data, *array ranges* can be specified

   -  C/C++: ``arr[start_index:length]``, for instance ``vec[0:n]``
   -  Fortran: ``arr(start_index:end_index)``, for instance ``vec(1:n)``

-  Note: array data **must** be *contiguous* in memory (vectors,
   multidimensional arrays etc.)

Default data environment in compute constructs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  All variables used inside the ``parallel`` or ``kernels`` region will
   be treated as *implicit* variables if they are not present in any
   data clauses, i.e. copying to and from the device is automatically
   performed
-  Implicit *array* variables are treated as having the ``copy`` clause
   in both cases
-  Implicit *scalar* variables are treated as having the

   -  ``copy`` clause in ``kernels``
   -  ``firstprivate`` clause in ``parallel``

Unstructured data regions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Unstructured data regions enable one to handle cases where allocation
   and freeing is done in a different scope
-  Useful for e.g. C++ classes, Fortran modules
-  ``enter data`` defines the start of an unstructured data region

   -  C/C++: ``#pragma acc enter data [clauses]``
   -  Fortran: ``!$acc enter data [clauses]``
   - [clauses] can be ``create(var-list)`` to allocate memory on the device or ``copyin(var-list)`` to allocate memory on the device and copy data from the host to the device

-  ``exit data`` defines the end of an unstructured data region

   -  C/C++: ``#pragma acc exit data [clauses]``
   -  Fortran: ``!$acc exit data [clauses]``
   - [clauses] can be ``delete(var-list)`` to deallocate memory on the device or ``copyout(var-list)`` to  Deallocate memory on the device and copy data from the device to  the host


Data directive: update
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Define variables to be updated within a data region between host and
   device memory

   -  C/C++: ``#pragma acc update [clauses]``
   -  Fortran: ``!$acc update [clauses]``

-  Data transfer direction controlled by ``host(var-list)`` or
   ``device(var-list)`` clauses

   -  ``self`` (``host``) clause updates variables from device to host
   -  ``device`` clause updates variables from host to device

.. -  At least one data direction clause must be present

-  ``update`` is a single line executable directive
-  Useful for producing snapshots of the device variables on the host or
   for updating variables on the device

   -  Pass variables to host for visualization
   -  Communication with other devices on other computing nodes

-  Often used in conjunction with

   -  Asynchronous execution of OpenACC constructs
   -  Unstructured data regions


Data directive: declare
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Makes a variable resident in accelerator memory
-  Added at the declaration of a variable
-  Data life-time on device is the implicit life-time of the variable

   -  C/C++: ``#pragma acc declare [clauses]``
   -  Fortran: ``!$acc declare [clauses]``

-  Supports usual data clauses, and additionally

   -  ``device_resident``
   -  ``link``


OpenACC execution model
-----------------------

-  OpenACC includes two different approaches for defining parallel
   regions

   -  ``parallel`` defines a region to be executed on an accelerator.
      Work sharing *parallelism* has to be defined *manually*. Good
      tuning prospects.
   -  ``kernels`` defines a region to be transferred into a series of
      kernels to be executed in *sequence* on an accelerator. Work
      sharing parallelism is defined *automatically* for the separate
      kernels, but tuning prospects limited.

-  With similar work sharing, both can perform equally well


Compute constructs: ``kernels``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Define a region to be transferred to a sequence of kernels for
   execution on the accelerator device

   -  C/C++: ``#pragma acc kernels [clauses]``
   -  Fortran: ``!$acc kernels [clauses]``

-  Each separate *loop nest* inside the region will be converted into a
   separate *parallel kernel*
-  The *kernels* will be executed in a *sequential* order

Compute constructs: ``parallel``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Define a region to be executed on the accelerator device

   - C/C++: ``#pragma acc parallel [clauses]``
   - Fortran: ``!$acc parallel [clauses]``

- Without any *work sharing* constructs, the whole region is executed
  *redundantly* multiple times

  - Given a sequence of loop nests, each loop nest may be executed simultaneously

Work sharing construct: ``loop``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Define a loop to be parallelized
    - C/C++: ``#pragma acc loop [clauses]``
    - Fortran: ``!$acc loop [clauses]``
    - Must be followed by a C/C++ or Fortran loop construct.
    - Combined constructs with ``parallel`` and ``kernels``
        - ``#pragma acc kernels loop / !$acc kernels loop``
        - ``#pragma acc parallel loop / !$acc parallel loop``
- Similar in functionality to OpenMP ``for/do`` construct
- Loop index variables are ``private`` variables by default


   -  ``accel`` – operations related to the accelerator
   -  ``all`` – print all compiler output
   -  ``intensity`` – print loop computational intensity info


Examples:
^^^^^^^^^

.. code :: c

   const int N=100;
   #pragma acc data copy(a[0:N])
   {
    #pragma acc parallel loop present(a)
    for (int i=0; i<N; i++)
        a[i] = a[i] + 1;
   }

   ...
   #pragma acc data copyout(a[0:N]), copyin(b[0:N])
   {
    #pragma acc parallel loop present(a,b)
    for (int i=0; i<N; i++)
        a[i] = b[i] + 1;
   }

   ...
   #pragma acc data copyout(a[0:N]), create(b[0:N])
   {
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (int i=0; i<N; i++)
        b[i] = i * 2.0;

    #pragma acc parallel loop present(a,b)
    for (int i=0; i<N; i++)
        a[i] = b[i] + 1;
   }
